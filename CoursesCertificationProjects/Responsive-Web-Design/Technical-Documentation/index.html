            <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly web applications. It was
                developed by Facebook and is now maintained by Meta and the open-source community.</p>
            <p>React allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the
                page. The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple.</p>
            <p>React uses a declarative programming paradigm, which means you describe what the UI should look like for
                any given state, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data
                changes.</p>
            <p>The library is component-based, allowing you to build encapsulated components that manage their own
                state, then compose them to make complex UIs.</p>
            <code>import React from 'react';</code>
            <ul>
                <li>Declarative: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs</li>
                <li>Component-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state</li>
                <li>Learn Once, Write Anywhere: Develop new features without rewriting existing code</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Getting_Started">
            <header>Getting Started</header>
            <p>To get started with React, you need to have Node.js installed on your computer. Once you have Node.js,
                you can use Create React App to set up a new React project quickly.</p>
            <p>Create React App is an officially supported way to create single-page React applications. It offers a
                modern build setup with no configuration.</p>
            <pre><code>npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start</code></pre>
            <p>This will create a new React application in the <code>my-app</code> directory and start the development
                server.</p>
            <p>The development server will automatically reload the page when you make changes to the source code,
                making development faster and more efficient.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Install Node.js from the official website</li>
                <li>Use npm or yarn as your package manager</li>
                <li>Create React App provides a good starting point for beginners</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Components">
            <header>Components</header>
            <p>Components are the building blocks of React applications. They let you split the UI into independent,
                reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.</p>
            <p>Components can be defined as JavaScript functions or classes. Function components are simpler and are the
                recommended way to write components in modern React.</p>
            <pre><code>function Welcome(props) {
  return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {props.name}!&lt;/h1&gt;;
}

// Or as an arrow function
const Welcome = (props) => {
  return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {props.name}!&lt;/h1&gt;;
};</code></pre>
            <p>Components can accept arbitrary inputs called "props" and return React elements describing what should
                appear on the screen.</p>
            <p>Always start component names with a capital letter. React treats components starting with lowercase
                letters as DOM tags.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Function components are simpler and more commonly used</li>
                <li>Class components have additional features like lifecycle methods</li>
                <li>Components should be pure functions when possible</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="State_and_Props">
            <header>State and Props</header>
            <p>Props (short for properties) are a way of passing data from parent to child components. They are
                read-only and should not be modified by the child component.</p>
            <p>State is a way for components to manage their own data. Unlike props, state can be changed using the
                <code>setState</code> method in class components or the <code>useState</code> hook in function
                components.
            </p>
            <pre><code>// Props example
function Greeting(props) {
  return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {props.name}!&lt;/h1&gt;;
}

// State example with useState hook
import { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You clicked {count} times&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setCount(count + 1)}&gt;
        Click me
      &lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}</code></pre>
            <p>State should be treated as immutable. Always use the setter function to update state, never modify state
                directly.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Props flow down from parent to child components</li>
                <li>State is local to the component that owns it</li>
                <li>State updates trigger re-renders of the component</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Hooks">
            <header>Hooks</header>
            <p>Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8 that let you use state and other React features without writing a
                class component.</p>
            <p>The most commonly used hooks are <code>useState</code> for managing state and <code>useEffect</code> for
                side effects like data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.</p>
            <pre><code>import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function UserProfile({ userId }) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchUser(userId).then(setUser);
  }, [userId]);
  
  if (!user) return &lt;div&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;;
  
  return &lt;div&gt;Welcome, {user.name}!&lt;/div&gt;;
}</code></pre>
            <p>Hooks follow two important rules: only call hooks at the top level of your React function, and only call
                hooks from React functions.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>useState: Adds state to function components</li>
                <li>useEffect: Performs side effects in function components</li>
                <li>useContext: Consumes context values</li>
                <li>useReducer: Alternative to useState for complex state logic</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Event_Handling">
            <header>Event Handling</header>
            <p>React events are named using camelCase, not lowercase. With JSX you pass a function as the event handler,
                rather than a string.</p>
            <p>React uses SyntheticEvent, a cross-browser wrapper around the browser's native event. It has the same
                interface as native events, but works consistently across all browsers.</p>
            <pre><code>function Button() {
  function handleClick(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log('The link was clicked.');
  }

  return (
    &lt;button onClick={handleClick}&gt;
      Click me
    &lt;/button&gt;
  );
}</code></pre>
            <p>You cannot return <code>false</code> to prevent default behavior in React. You must call
                <code>preventDefault</code> explicitly.
            </p>
            <p>Event handlers receive a SyntheticEvent object as their first parameter, which wraps the native event and
                provides a consistent API across different browsers.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use camelCase for event names (onClick, onChange, onSubmit)</li>
                <li>Pass functions as event handlers, not strings</li>
                <li>Use preventDefault() to prevent default browser behavior</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Lifecycle_Methods">
            <header>Lifecycle Methods</header>
            <p>Lifecycle methods are special methods in class components that run at specific points in a component's
                life. They allow you to hook into different phases of a component's existence.</p>
            <p>The three main phases are mounting (when component is created), updating (when props or state change),
                and unmounting (when component is removed).</p>
            <p>In modern React with hooks, lifecycle methods are replaced by the <code>useEffect</code> hook, which can
                handle all lifecycle scenarios.</p>
            <pre><code>// Class component lifecycle
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    // Runs after component mounts
  }
  
  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
    // Runs after component updates
  }
  
  componentWillUnmount() {
    // Runs before component unmounts
  }
}

// Hook equivalent
function MyComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // componentDidMount logic
    
    return () => {
      // componentWillUnmount logic
    };
  }, []); // Empty dependency array = componentDidMount
}</code></pre>
            <p>Common lifecycle methods include <code>componentDidMount</code>, <code>componentDidUpdate</code>, and
                <code>componentWillUnmount</code>.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mounting: constructor, componentDidMount</li>
                <li>Updating: componentDidUpdate, getSnapshotBeforeUpdate</li>
                <li>Unmounting: componentWillUnmount</li>
                <li>Error Handling: componentDidCatch, getDerivedStateFromError</li>
            </ul>
